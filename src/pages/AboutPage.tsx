          dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, the embodiment of dharma, devotion, and discipline. This

          Lord Ayyappa, the son of Lord Shiva and Mohini (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu), is known
          as the protector of dharma and a symbol of unity between Shaivites and Vaishnavites.
          The chant ‚ÄúSwamiye Saranam Ayyappa‚Äù echoes devotion, surrender, and strength.
